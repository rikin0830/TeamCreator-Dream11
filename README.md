# Project_1
# Brief intro
A C++ code which creates the top 5 Dream-11 teams(on the basis of stats) for a cricket match.<br/>
All we can do to predict the future is to look at the past.<br/>
Even ML models are trained on training data sets(based on past) before using them on testing data sets(to predict the future).<br/>

# Requirements:
If you are a fan of cricket and know about Dream 11, with a little bit of C++ knowledge, we can get along very easily in using this code.<br/>

# Purpose of this project:
As we both know, there are many dream11 teams possible for a given match.<br/>
Using simple math and the rule of minimum 4 players from each team,we can calculate the max number of teams possible is 644688.<br/>
Note that we still didnt add constraints on total cost of team(<=100) and mininum and maximum from each category and we haven't even decided                        Captain and Vice-Captain yet.<br/>
644688 maybe a big number for us,but for our computer, it isn't.<br/>
So we are going to use its power and give the playing 22 as input and extract the best 5 teams possible by considering all possible constraints.<br/>

# Overview:
I built a database/csv file using previous IPL stats from iplt20.com,<br/>
In the case of a player who didn't play previous IPL I manually checked his profile and added an approxiamate analysis based entry to the database.<br/>
The csv file consists of 5 columns:<br/>
Column1 - Name of player<br/>
Column3 - Number of matches played recently <br/>
Column2 - Avg points in those matches<br/>
Column4 - Cost of player in Dream11.<br/>
Column5 - Role of the player(0 for wk,1 for batsman,2 for all-rounder,3 for bowler)<br/>

# How to use the code?
There are 2 aspects to the code that I wrote:<br/>
1. Create best 5 teams by giving playing 22(playing 22 is generally revealed after toss)<br/>
2. Updating database after the match. (This is important because some player's stats might be bad but he is performing excellent this IPL or vice versa)<br/>

So let's talk about Point-1 first:<br/>
# How to use the code for generating best 5 teams?
I have taken standard input from INPUT.txt and standard output to OUTPUT.txt ,in sublime text,(If you don't want to use sublime then comment the stext function call in line 398 of the code)<br/>
Write "create" in the first line of the input file (INPUT.txt in my case)<br/>
Then in the next 22 lines write name of each player(without spaces)<br/>
(NOTE::The first 11 lines should contain playing 11 of 1 team and the next 11 players should be of the other team.) <br/>
<br/>
Case-(1):In case the code doesn't find a player mentioned in the input file,<br/>
The code doesn't execute and gives the names of players who weren't found.<br/>
Case-(2):The code finds all players in the csv file and executes and prints the best 5 teams to OUTPUT.txt<br/>

SampleOutput-2 : <br/>
-----------------------
The following player/players were not found in the csv:<br/>
SandeepSma<br/>
Viratohli<br/>
AbdeVillier<br/>

Note that now I have deliberately introduced some typos in the sample input.<br/>
But the code finds them out.Even in the next part(database update) the code first checks whether all players mentioned are in the csv or not and gives an error like this(SampleOutput-2) if any player is not available in the csv.<br/>
# How to update the database after the match?
I have taken standard input from INPUT.txt and standard output to OUTPUT.txt ,in sublime text,(If you don't want to use sublime then comment the stext function call in line 398 of the code)<br/>
Write "update" in the first line of INPUT.txt,which is followed by 22 lines containing each player and number of points earned by him in that match.<br/>
Case-(1): Due to typo,the player might not be found in the csv file. <br/>
In that case the code doesn't execute at all and just reports all the players who weren't found in the csv file.<br/>
Case-(2): The code finds that all 22 players are available in the csv file,<br/>
So it updates "avg points" aka Column 2 and "number of innings" aka Column 3 for each player.<br/>

SampleInput(Based on match on 21 sept 2020)for updating database:<br/>

SampleOutput:<br/>
Update Complete <br/>

# Few points to note :

Make sure that D11CODE.cpp,INPUT.txt,OUTPUT.txt,STATS.csv remain in the same folder.<br/>
Since database should be updated after every match the STATS.csv file will be updated and uploaded daily by 5pm.<br/>

Advantages of this code:
------------------------
1. You don't need to waste your time thinking of all combinations(one may think of 50 combinations at max) because the program has viewed over all possible team combinations (approx 3 lakh - 4 lakh possible teams) <br/>
2. You can just make some tweaks to one of the best 5 teams that you find promising(based on form of a player,based on pitch , etc). <br/>

Disadvantages of this code:
---------------------------
1. The main disadvantage of this code is that it can't recognize so-called "form" of a player. So you need to make some final tweaks after getting the output<br/>
2. Dream11 is mainly based on luck,Even expert batsmen get run-out/ or a very young player who hasn't performed till that day,becomes Man of the match.<br/>
   So this code can't predict these instances,which are dependant on pure luck.<br/>

# Thank You Note:
This is my first github based project,so it is a little sloppy I guess,I hope I didn't bore you :D
Thank you for making it this far.<br/>
I would like to thank<br/>
1) iplt20.com for providing stats freely for anyone who wants to use them<br/>
2) geeksforgeeks.com for using makeCombi function (from line 53 to line 73 in the code)<br/>
3) Google for having lots of info about players whose stats weren't available in iplt20.com(because  they didn't play previous IPL)<br/>
4) BVS Sudhindra and codelover_22 from codeforces for brilliant insights and ideas when I was coding this project.<br/>
